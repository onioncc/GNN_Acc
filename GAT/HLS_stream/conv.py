        Implementation #2 was inspired by the official GAT implementation: https://github.com/PetarV-/GAT

        It's conceptually simpler than implementation #3 but computationally much less efficient.

        Note: this is the naive implementation not the sparse one and it's only suitable for a transductive setting.
        It would be fairly easy to make it work in the inductive setting as well but the purpose of this layer
        is more educational since it's way less efficient than implementation 3.
